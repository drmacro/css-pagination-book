  <h1 class="title topictitle1" id="ariaid-title1">Introduction to CSS Pagination</h1>
  <div class="body">
    <p class="p">The Cascading Style Sheet specification, CSS, was originally developed to make it easy to
      apply styles to HTML and XML content in browsers. As originally developed it was not designed
      to meet the more challenging requirements of paged output. While CSS can be applied to
      arbitrary XML, it was primarily designed to meet the needs of styling HTML and that continues
      to be its focus today.</p>
    <p class="p">In the late 1990's and early 2000s the XSL Formatting Objects specification (XSL-FO or just
      "FO" for short) was developed as a technology for producing paged output from XML. It met that
      need well and has been used widely for the production of pages for technical manuals, utility
      bills and similar business documents, and other publications that require a completely
      automated publishing process and for which XSL-FO's layout features are sufficient.</p>
    <p class="p">While XSL-FO works well it requires skills and knowledge that are not widely available.
      XSL-FO requires the use of XSLT transforms to generate the XSL-FO documents that are then the
      input to XSL-FO formatting engines. Like any complex and specialized technology, XSL-FO can be
      a challenge to learn.</p>
    <p class="p">In the years since the XSL-FO specification was first published the CSS community has started
      adding pagination features to CSS in order to enable CSS-based styling of paged output as well
      as browser-based output.</p>
    <p class="p">I was one of the developers of the XSL-FO specification and one of the earlier implementors
      of XSL-FO-based systems. At the time, XSL-FO was the only available standard for doing
      high-quality pagination of XML content (older standards like DSSSL were not supported by that
      time). It allowed us to implement batch composition that was effective and affordable. One of
      my earliest XSL-FO clients was Nokia's mobile phone group, who needed to be able to produce
      mobile phone manuals in more that 40 national languages for release at the same time world
      wide. They wanted to be able to use a single source format, XML, and a single publication tool
      chain, something they had not been able to do before. We were able to implement an XSLT- and
      XSL-FO-based solution that met all their requirements, including publishing documents in
      Arabic, Hebrew, Thai, and a number of south-Asian scripts, all of which present significant
      typographic challenges.</p>
    <p class="p">Fast forward 15 years and the situation had not changed much: XSL-FO was still the only
      standard for doing high-quality pagination of XML-based content and it was still in wide use.
      In the DITA community, in particular, XSL-FO was almost universally used for producing
      printable versions of DITA-based publications. But the use of XSL-FO presented a number of
      problems: it's a challenging standard to master on its own, the number of people who know it
      is small, and the free open-source tooling for using XSL-FO with DITA was hard to use, making
      creating good-looking pages from DITA harder than it should have been.</p>
    <p class="p">By 2015 the CSS pagination specifications had reached a level of maturity that made it
      possible to use CSS pagination for the kinds of publications that XSL-FO had been used for up
      to that point. At the same time, a number of commercial tools emerged that support CSS
      pagination reasonably well, include the Prince XML product, the Antenna House Formatter CSS
      processor, and the Vivliostyles in-browser CSS pagination tool. Unfortunately, no
      sufficiently-complete open-source solution was available (or is available as of spring
      2018).</p>
    <div class="p">The use of CSS for pagination in place of XSL-FO offers a number of compelling advantages, if
      it works:<ul class="ul" id="introduction__ul_vc5_z1b_vcb">
        <li class="li">Many more people are familiar with CSS and, even if it's not really any easier to do
          pagination with it, will be more likely to try simply because "it's CSS"</li>
        <li class="li">Existing CSS skills and knowledge are directly applicable to using CSS for
          pagination</li>
        <li class="li">CSS style sheets can be shared between web and print delivery, making it easier to
          coordinate look and feel among print and online delivery of the same content.</li>
        <li class="li">It makes a clearer separation between the concern of layout design and implementation
          ("graphic design") and the data processing needed to prepare content for pagination
          (transformation). This makes it easier to adjust the styling of publications without
          needing direct knowledge of XSLT programming.</li>
        <li class="li">The syntax of CSS is simpler and more compact than the syntax of XSL-FO, making it
          generally easier to work with, or at least more approachable.</li>
        <li class="li">There is a lot of tooling and infrastructure around CSS as a coding format, systems such
          as sass and less as well as CSS awareness in typical web development tools.</li>
      </ul></div>
    <div class="p">CSS for pagination does present some challenges, however:<ul class="ul" id="introduction__ul_bpk_qbb_vcb">
        <li class="li">There is no sufficiently-complete open-source solution as their is for XSL-FO (the
          Apache FOP project). That means you must invest in a commercial tool to do anything
          non-trivial with CSS for pagination.</li>
        <li class="li">The CSS pagination specifications are not fully developed, meaning that there are
          aspects that are underspecified or in flux, features that are missing, and so on.</li>
        <li class="li">The specifications themselves are scattered across many different individual documents,
          making it a challenge to find answers to specific how-to questions.</li>
        <li class="li">Except for the book you're reading now, there is no centralized repository of knowledge
          and guidance for CSS pagination.</li>
      </ul></div>
    <p class="p">As someone who has been directly involved with XSL-FO and its application for many years, I
      have decided that, on balance, CSS for pagination is the better solution for most batch
      composition applications where the layout requirements can be met by XSL-FO and where budget
      allows licensing of a commercial CSS pagination tool. My analysis is the CSS-based pagination
      solutions will be easier to implement and, more importantly, easier to maintain over time,
      than the equivalent XSL-FO solution. Having spent more than a decade working with XSL-FO I
      would be happy to never have to work with it again because I find CSS to be that much easier
      to work with, flaws and all.</p>
    <p class="p">(There are batch composition applications where XSL-FO cannot meet all the requirements and
      in those cases proprietary technology is usually the right answer, such as the Typefi system
      for use with Adobe Illustrator. And of course in some cases fully-automated layout is simply
      not possible, such as highly-designed books and magazines, where at least some amount of
      manual work is always required.)</p>
    <p class="p">The purpose of this book is to capture the practical knowledge of how to do pagination with
      CSS that I've developed in the course of doing several CSS pagination projects with
      sophisticated and challenging layout requirements, projects that I would in the past have used
      XSL-FO for.</p>
    <p class="p">My hope is that this book will allow you to be productive with CSS pagination quickly,
      avoiding the pain I went through to learn how to do this.</p>
    <p class="p">Make no mistake: creating high-quality pages from sophisticated content is a challenge no
      matter what technology you use to do it. CSS can't make creating good pages easy any more than
      InDesign can. What it can do is make not be harder than it has to be and I think that's what
      CSS largely does, in the context of a batch composition system.</p>
    <p class="p">This book assumes that you have arbitrary XML representing some kind of publicationâ€”DITA,
      JATS, S20001D, or some home-grown vocabularyâ€”and you want to use CSS to produce pages from
      it.</p>
    <p class="p">If you are authoring directly in HTML then your task is only slightly easier. For the
      purposes of this book, directly-authored HTML is just another flavor of arbitrary XML and all
      the same workflows and processing pipelines apply.</p>
  </div>
<article class="topic division nested1" aria-labelledby="ariaid-title2" id="how-css-pagination-works">
  <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title2">How CSS Pagination Works</h2>
  
  <div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">CSS pagination takes HTML as input and produces pages as output.</p>
    <div class="p">To produce pages from your XML source using CSS you need two things:<ol class="ol" id="how-css-pagination-works__ol_ehz_32b_vcb">
        <li class="li">A transform, presumably implemented in XSLT, that takes your XML as input and produces
          what I call "CSS ready" HTML as output.</li>
        <li class="li">A CSS pagination engine that takes the CSS-ready HTML as input and produces pages (e.g.,
          PDF) as output.</li>
      </ol></div>
    <p class="p">Why is this transform necessary, even if you are authoring directly in HTML?</p>
    <div class="p">There are two main reasons:<ol class="ol" id="how-css-pagination-works__ol_r23_kfb_vcb">
        <li class="li">CSS is optimized for use with HTML and most of your existing CSS style sheets will
          already be for HTML. So it's much easier to style HTML with CSS than to style arbitrary
          XML.</li>
        <li class="li">CSS cannot itself do transformation, it only decorates. So if anything in your source
          needs to be moved or if you need to generate anything, such as tables of contents, there
          must be a separate transform that does it.</li>
      </ol></div>
    <p class="p">Thus, any non-trivial CSS-based pagination system will always involve a transform that
      produces HTML optimized for styling with CSS. More about these transforms later.</p>
    <div class="p">I call the transformation that produces pagination-ready HTML the "HTML preparation
      transform" or sometimes "the HTML preprocessor". The main tasks of the HTML preparation
      transform are:<ul class="ul" id="how-css-pagination-works__ul_gzy_n2h_vcb">
        <li class="li">Construct elements needed to populate running headers, running feet, or side elements
          (for example thumb tabs).</li>
        <li class="li">To add @class attribute values or other attributes to elements to work around
          limitations in CSS selectors. In particular, you cannot select elements based on
          properties of following siblings or get attribute values from ancestor elements.</li>
        <li class="li">Generate tables of contents, back-of-the-book indexes, and other structures that are
          part of your deliverable but not authored in the source.</li>
        <li class="li">Move elements that are not presented in the order they are authored. For example, in
          DITA moving the titles of figures to the bottom of the figure container (DITA figures are
          authored with the figure title as the first subelement of the figure container).</li>
        <li class="li">Add wrapper elements in order to control page sequence association.</li>
      </ul></div>
    <p class="p">For most, if not all, typical documentation-focused XML applications there is already one or
      more general HTML-generation transforms available. So for the HTML preparation transform can
      either be an extension to these existing transforms or a separate, much simpler transform
      applied to the HTML produced by these transforms.</p>
    <p class="p">If you are authoring directly in HTML then the HTML preparation transform should be fairly
      simple. </p>
    <p class="p">To actually produce the pages you need a "pagination engine", a processor that takes your
      prepared HTML and the associated CSS as input and produces pages from it. Note that no
      browsers are ever likely to do CSS pagination out of the box for a number of reasons, some
      good, some not so good. So even within a browser you'll need a tool to do the pagination, such
      as the Vivliostyle engine, which uses JavaScript in the browser to render pages directly (it
      can also be used as a standalone engine using a JavaScript server).</p>
    <p class="p">The more typical use case is to use a standalone CSS pagination engine like Antenna House
      Formatter or Prince, which produce PDF or other formats.</p>
    <p class="p">For the purposes of this book I will assume that you are using a standalone engine to produce
      PDFs. Just know that there other options.</p>
    <p class="p">CSS pagination extends the base CSS model by adding new CSS rules for defining pages and for
      associating elements with page rules. CSS pagination also provides additional CSS features
      specific to paged output, such as page number references, footnotes, and additional features
      for generated text.</p>
    <p class="p">For the content of pages you use normal CSS styling exactly as you would for HTML rendered in
      a browser.</p>
    <p class="p">Note that having the styling definition, the CSS style sheet, separate from the transformation
      that prepares the source data to be styled, creates an important <dfn class="term">separation of
        concerns</dfn> that is not present in most other batch composition systems and certainly
      not in most XSL-FO-based publishing processes.</p>
    <p class="p">The reason this separation of concerns is important is because transforming XML and styling
      content are two very different skills that are usually done by different people.</p>
    <p class="p">In an XSL-FO-based approach the graphic designer who designs the layout details has to then
      communicate the design to an engineer who implements a transform that generates the
      appropriate XSL-FO markup to achieve the desired design. This either creates a level of
      separation between the graphic designer and the realization of their design or, as seems to be
      the case more often, it requires graphic designers to become XSL-FO programmers.</p>
    <p class="p">By contrast, the CSS-based approach creates a cleaner separation between the graphic design
      implementation activity, which is mostly implemented through the CSS styule sheets, and the
      data preparation activity, which is implemented through XSLT or some similar transformation
      mechanism. While there is still a need for coordination between the graphic designer and the
      transformation engineer, it is mostly about @class values, elements needed for running heads
      and feet and generation of things like tables of contents. Once the HTML preparation details
      have been determined, the styling can be developed and changed without any need for additional
      transformation engineering work.</p>
    <p class="p">In addition, the overall complexity of the transformation required is usually much lower than
      the equivalent XSL-FO-generating transformation would be, making the transformation engineer's
      job easier and, potentially, making that task accessible to people who are not primarily XSLT
      engineers. Even if the process requires development of an XML-to-HTML transform for the
      content, that transform tends to be easier to implement than an XML-to-XSL-FO transform.</p>
    <p class="p">Basically, a CSS-based pagination process has the effect of breaking the data processing and
      implementation definition problem into several smaller parts, each one of which is easier to
      create and manage than a single XML-to-XSL-FO process would be, while also making it easier to
      apply the right skills to each component of the process.</p>

    <h1 class="title topictitle1" id="ariaid-title3">CSS Basics</h1>
  
    <div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">A brief introduction to the basics of CSS.</p>
        <p class="p">There is no shortage of good introductory material on CSS available. This topic is not
      intended to replace those resources. Rather, it's mostly just to provide a level set on basic
      CSS concepts and terminology.</p>
    <p class="p">A CSS style sheet consists of a set of <dfn class="term">rules</dfn>.</p>
    <p class="p">There are two types of rules: <dfn class="term">rule sets</dfn> and <dfn class="term">at-rules</dfn>.</p>
    <div class="p"><dfn class="term">Rule sets</dfn> are rules that start with a <dfn class="term">selector</dfn> and then a
      declaration <dfn class="term">block</dfn> containing zero or more <dfn class="term">properties</dfn> to be applied
      to the elements that match the
      selector:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>p.note {
  margin-left: 1pc;
  border: 1pt solid black;
  padding: 4pt;
}</code></pre></div>
    <p class="p">A <dfn class="term">block</dfn> starts with a left curly brace ('{') and ends with the matching right
      curly brace ('}').</p>
    <p class="p">Here <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;p.note&gt;</code> is the <dfn class="term">selector</dfn>, in this case selecting
        <code class="keyword markupname xmlelement">&lt;p&gt;</code> elements with a <code class="keyword markupname xmlatt">@class</code> value that includes the
      keyword "note" (e.g., <code class="ph codeph">&lt;p class="note"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>). The <dfn class="term">block</dfn>
      includes three properties, <span class="keyword">margin-left</span>, <span class="keyword">border</span>, and
        <span class="keyword">padding</span>.</p>
    <div class="p"><dfn class="term">At-rules</dfn> are rules that start with
        <code class="ph codeph">@<var class="keyword varname">identifier</var></code> and continue up to the next semicolon or
        <dfn class="term">block</dfn>, whichever comes
      first:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>@import "page-masters.css" print;

@page :first {
  counter-reset: page;
}</code></pre></div>
    <p class="p">Here the <span class="keyword">@import</span> at-rule imports a style sheet named "page-masters.css"
      when the media query includes "print" and the <span class="keyword">@page</span> rule applies to first
      pages and resets the counter named "page".</p>
    <div class="p">CSS comments start with "/*" and end with
      "*/":<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>/* This is a comment 
   Second line of comment
 */</code></pre></div>
    <p class="p">CSS does not have single-line comments.</p>
    <p class="p">CSS style rules <dfn class="term">cascade</dfn> based on <dfn class="term">precedence</dfn> such that all the rules
      that match a given element are combined together to determine the final effective set of
      properties. Cascading rules are somewhat complex but in general the last declaration in the
      style sheet wins, which means that you should put more-specific style rules after
      less-specific style rules.</p>
    <div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title">Note:</span> Rather than try to understand and internalize all the rules for style rule precedence and
      inheritance, I depend on browser's web development tools to show me what actually happened.
      For example, in Chrome you can inspect an element and see exactly which rules contributed
      which values to the final property set.</div>
    <div class="p">You can organize CSS style sheets into separate modules that can be imported using
        <span class="keyword">@import</span> at-rules at the top of the style sheet. You can use a
      comma-separated list of media types on the <span class="keyword">@import</span> rule to limit the
      imports to specific media, e.g.
      "print":<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>@import "page-masters.css" <strong class="ph b">print</strong>;
@import "pagination-rules.css" <strong class="ph b">print</strong>;
@import "common.css";</code></pre></div>
    <div class="p">The URI of the style sheet to be imported can be specified as a quoted string or using the
        <span class="keyword">url()</span>
      function:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>@import <strong class="ph b">url("page-masters.css")</strong> print;</code></pre></div>
    <p class="p">All <span class="keyword">@import</span> rules must occur before any other rules in the style
      sheet.</p>
    <div class="p">Property values are one of the following types:<ul class="ul" id="css-basics__ul_eb1_gzh_vcb">
        <li class="li">Literal strings delimited with single or double

  display: none;
}</code></pre></div>
      <p class="p">Note that sometimes you want things to be hidden rather than completely thrown away, in
        which case you may need to do things like make the font size very small (e.g., "0.1pt") or
        use a color of "white" to hide it. You may need to check how your CSS engine treats "none"
        display elements.</p>
      <p class="p">You can use a <span class="keyword">display:</span> value of "table" or one of the other
        table-component keywords to map non-table elements to a tabular presentation. Depending on
        your source markup, you may need to generate extra elements to serve as table rows or table
        cells. Note that you can use :before and :after pseudo elements as cells (but usually not
        rows).</p>

    <div class="body">
      <div class="p">CSS boxes have three properties that determine the effective content area of the box:<ul class="ul" id="topic_ucl_p33_vcb__ul_zjb_s33_vcb">
          <li class="li">Margin: Space from the outside edge of the box to any border or padding.</li>
          <li class="li">Border: Occurs between the margin and padding.</li>
          <li class="li">Padding: Occurs between the border and the content rectangle.</li>
        </ul></div>
      <p class="p">The margin, border, and padding can be different for each of the four sides of a box.</p>

      </figure>
      <p class="p">The sum of the margin, border, and padding for two parallel sides is subtracted from the
        total width of the box to determine the width or height of the box's content area.</p>
      <p class="p">For example, on an 8.5x11 inch page, if you specify a left margin of 1in and right margin
        of 1.5in, then the width of the page's content area is 8.5 - (1+1.5) or 6in.</p>
      <p class="p">More generally, margins create vertical space between blocks or create indention for
        blocks, padding separates the border from the content, and borders are borders.</p>
      <p class="p">Boxes can nest, so the edge of the content area for an outer box becomes the start of the
        outside of the margin area for an inner box, as shown here:</p>

              often either don't have a built-in base style sheet or you need to override it in

              of how your CSS pagination engine is configured. For example, Antenna House Formatter
              uses a font mapping configuration to map font names as used on the

  <div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">You use <span class="keyword">@page</span> rules to define page masters.</p>
    <p class="p">In order to generate pages from your content you must define what those pages look like:
      their height and width, where the headers and footers go, the details of footnote placement,
      and so on. These definitions are usually referred to as "page masters".</p>
    <div class="p">In CSS page masters are defined using <dfn class="term">page rules</dfn>:<a name="fnsrc_1" href="#fntarg_1"><sup>1</sup></a><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>@page {
  size: A4 portrait; 
  counter-increment: page;
  margin-top: 6pc;
  margin-bottom: 6pc;
  margin-left: 8pc;
  margin-right: 7pc;
  
  @bottom-center {
      content: counter(page);
      text-align: center;
  }
}</code></pre></div>
    <p class="p">This page rule defines an A4 page with the page number displayed at the center of the bottom
      of the page.</p>
    <p class="p">A CSS page has a <dfn class="term">body region</dfn>, which is where flowed content goes, and zero or
      more <dfn class="term">page margin boxes</dfn>. The size of the body region is determined by specifying
      margins for the page.</p>
    <p class="p">You can specify the size of the page, either using a pre-defined page size keyword, as shown
      here, using explicit measurements for the height and width. When you use a page size keyword
      you can specify <span class="keyword">portrait</span> or <span class="keyword">landscape</span> to indicate the
      page orientation.</p>
    <p class="p">A page can have a background image as for any block in CSS.</p>
    <p class="p">A page can have a footnote area with borders. Footnote areas are only generated if a page has
      one or more footnotes on it.</p>
    <p class="p">The above <span class="keyword">@page</span> rule defines a generic page. If this was the only
        <span class="keyword">@page</span> rule in the style sheet it would be used for all pages.</p>
    <p class="p">However, most publications need different page masters for different purposes: left and right
      pages, first pages, last pages, pages for frontmatter, foldout pages, etc.</p>
    <div class="bodydiv fo-mapping">
      <p class="p">CSS @page rules correspond to FO simple-page-master.</p>

  <article class="topic division nested1" aria-labelledby="ariaid-title9" id="topic_gcq_lpb_vcb">
    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title9">Defining Page Sequences</h2>
    <div class="body">
      <p class="p">In many publications you will need to define not just individual page masters but
          <dfn class="term">page sequences</dfn>, sets of pages that are used together for specific
        content.</p>
      <p class="p">For publications that are intended to be printed on paper, you usually have different page
        masters for left and right pages. You often also need to account for the first page of the
        sequence (e.g., chapter openers), the last page of the sequence, and blank pages (for
        example, to generate "This page intentionally left blank" on blank pages. In addition, first
        pages usually have different running heads or feet from non-first pages. </p>
      <div class="bodydiv fo-mapping">FO conditional page sequence masters become sequences of
        page rule names coupled with @page rule selectors to get the same effect. CSS page sequence
        controls are not as complete as FO's but should be sufficient for most use cases.</div>
      <div class="p">A <span class="keyword">@page</span> rule can be applied to pages of specific types using one or more
          <dfn class="term">page selectors</dfn>:<ul class="ul" id="topic_gcq_lpb_vcb__ul_ugw_fqb_vcb">
          <li class="li">First page (<span class="keyword">:first</span>)</li>
          <li class="li">Left page:(<span class="keyword">:left</span>)</li>
          <li class="li">Right page (<span class="keyword">:right</span>)</li>
          <li class="li">Blank page (<span class="keyword">:blank</span>)</li>
          <li class="li">Last page (<span class="keyword">:last</span>, Antenna House Formatter extension)</li>
        </ul></div>
      <div class="p">You can specify one or more page selectors on a <span class="keyword">@page</span>
        rule:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>@page <strong class="ph b">:left :blank</strong> {
  size: A4 portrait; 
  counter-increment: page;

  margin-top: 6pc;
  margin-bottom: 6pc;
  margin-left: 8pc;
  margin-right: 7pc;
  
  @bottom-center {
      content: none;
  }
}</code></pre></div>
      <p class="p">For a typical page sequence you need to define a first page rule, a left page rule, and a
        right page rule. If you have special handling for blank pages, you will need a blank page
        rule.</p>
      <p class="p">While there is some cascading of properties from <span class="keyword">@page</span> rule to
          <span class="keyword">@page</span> rule, it's limited and somewhat difficult to predict or control.
        Therefore, it's usually best to define each page master completely.</p>
      <p class="p">The only exception is using an initial generic <span class="keyword">@page</span> rule to set the
        defaults for all subsequent page rules.</p>
      <div class="p">For example, if all or most of the pages will have the same size and orientation then it
        makes sense to use an unqualified <span class="keyword">@page</span> rule to define those, allowing
        you to simplify more specific <span class="keyword">@page</span>
        rules:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>/* Base page rule for most pages */
@page {
  size: A4 portrait; 
  counter-increment: page;
  margin-top: 6pc;
  margin-bottom: 6pc;
  
  @bottom-center {
      content: counter(page);
      text-align: center;
  }
}

/* Duplex pages with wider
   binding-edge margins:
 */
@page left: {
  margin-left: 5pc;
  right-right: 8pc;
}

@page right: {
  margin-left: 8pc;
  right-right: 5pc;
}</code></pre></div>
      <p class="p">This set of <span class="keyword">@page</span> rules defines all pages to be A4 portrait pages with
        the page number at the bottom. The left and right page rules create a wider binding (inside)
        edge margin, typical for duplex (double sided) pages.</p>
      <p class="p">For many documents you need not just different first or left and right pages, but different
        pages for different parts of your publication.</p>
      <p class="p">For example, your frontmatter pages may use roman numerals for the page number or your
        index pages may have different margins.</p>
      <div class="p">You create different related sets of page masters by using names on the
          <span class="keyword">@page</span>
        rules:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>@page <strong class="ph b">frontmatter</strong> left: {
  margin-left: 5pc;
  right-right: 8pc;

  @bottom-center {
      content: counter(page, lower-roman);
      text-align: center;
  }

}</code></pre></div>
      <p class="p">Here "frontmatter" is the <span class="keyword">@page</span> rule identifier. </p>
      <div class="p">You refer to <span class="keyword">@page</span> rule identifiers from <span class="keyword">page:</span>
        properties in element-specific
        rules:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>section.front {
  <strong class="ph b">page: frontmatter;</strong>
}</code></pre></div>
      <p class="p">This rule applies the page rules named "frontmatter" to section elements that have the
        @class value "front".</p>
      <p class="p">The CSS processor will automatically select the correct <span class="keyword">@page</span> rule based
        on the type of page being generatedâ€”you don't have to specify anything in the
          <span class="keyword">page:</span> rule itself.</p>
      <p class="p">You can specify a list of page names on the <span class="keyword">page:</span> property in order to
        define a page sequence.</p>
      <div class="p">For example, you might need different first page masters for different kinds of sections
        but all the following pages are the same. Because the first pages are different you need
        different named rules for each one but you then need to use pages from a different set for
        the remaining pages. In this example, the last <span class="keyword">@page</span> rule defines a page
        just for the first page of the table of contents. The rule for <code class="ph codeph">&lt;section
          class="toc"&gt;</code> then specifies a sequence page rule names: toc-first
        portrait.<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>/* Base page rules for portrait pages */
@page portrait {
  size: A4 portrait; 
  counter-increment: page;
  margin-top: 6pc;
  margin-bottom: 6pc;
  
  @bottom-center {
      content: counter(page);
      text-align: center;
  }
}

/* Duplex pages with wider
   binding-edge margins:
 */
@page portrait left: {
  margin-left: 5pc;
  right-right: 8pc;
}

@page portrait right: {
  margin-left: 8pc;
  right-right: 5pc;
}

/* Table of Contents first page
   title starts lower and has
   a narrower body area.
 */
<strong class="ph b">@page toc-first :first :right {</strong>
    <strong class="ph b">margin-top: 3in;
    margin-left: 10pc;
    margin-right: 12pc;
</strong><strong class="ph b">}</strong>

section.toc {
  <strong class="ph b">page: toc-first portrait;
   break-before: right;
</strong>}</code></pre></div>
      <p class="p">Note that the "toc-first" page rule specifies both <span class="keyword">:first</span> and

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title10">Creating Running Heads and Feet (and Other Marginalia)</h2>
    <div class="body">
      <p class="p">You create running heads and feet by defining page margin boxes and specifying what content
        to put into them.</p>
      <div class="bodydiv fo-mapping">CSS page margin boxes correspond to FO edge regions defined
        in page masters and static content within page sequences. In FO you define the presence,
        name, and extent of the margin regions in page masters, but specify the region content as
        part of each page sequence. In CSS the boxes, including their content, are entirely defined
        in the page master rule.</div>
      <p class="p">CSS pages have a total of twelve possible margin boxes: one for each corner of the page and
        three on each side:</p>
      <figure class="fig fignone" id="topic_fws_skc_vcb__fig-page-margin-boxes"><figcaption><span class="fig--title-label">Figure 4. </span>Page margin boxes</figcaption>
        
        <br><img class="image" id="topic_fws_skc_vcb__image_c5q_1rc_vcb" height="384" src="media/page-margin-boxes-01.png" alt="Shows the twelve page margin boxes."><br>
      </figure>
      <div class="p">Each page margin box has a corresponding at-rule named for the
        box:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>@page {
  size: A4;
  counter-increment: page;

  /* Chapter title */
  @top-left {
    content: string(chapterTitle);
    font-size: 9pt;
  }

  /* Section Title */
  @top-right {
    content: string(sectionTitle, first);
  }

  @bottom-middle {
    content: counter(page);
  }
}</code></pre></div>
      <p class="p">The vertical extent of top and bottom boxes is determined by the page's top and bottom
        margin, padding, and border. The horizontal extent of left and right boxes is likewise
        determined by the page's left and right margin, border, and padding.</p>
      <p class="p">The horizontal extent of top and bottom boxes and the vertical extent of left and right
        boxes is determined dynamically by the processor and cannot be explicitly determined through
        the CSS properties, although you might be able to do tricks with giving elements used by
        reference in margin boxes fixed extents, depending on what your processor does.</p>
      <p class="p">The margin box specification seems to indicate that processors should try to divide the
        available space evenly among the margin boxes while trying to center the center and middle
        boxes. There is no way, for example, to force the top-left box to be wide and the top middle
        box to narrow. This can make it a challenge to precisely control the header and footer
        layout. It's clear that the goal of the CSS design was to make specifying margin boxes easy
        but it has the effect of not supporting some important use cases. Hopefully this is an area
        of the spec that will be refined in the future.</p>
      <p class="p">Note also that the size of the corner regions is determined by the extent of the top and
        side margins at each corner.</p>
      <div class="bodydiv fo-mapping">In XSL-FO you can control how the side regions interact with
        each other at the corners. In particular, you can set up your pages so that the side regions
        extend the full vertical extent of the page, which is usually what you want so that the top
        and bottom regions are aligned with the extent of the body region. You cannot do this in
        CSS, as the corners are separate boxes and there is no defined way to merge the corner
        regions with the other regions to create a single page-spanning region.</div>
      <div class="p">Page margin boxes are only created when the content property of the box is not "none". You
        can "turn off" a margin box created by an inherited page master by defining the margin box
        with an explicit <span class="keyword">content:</span> value of "none". For example, you might define
        the running heads and feet in your base page rules and then override the running heads in
        the first-page master to turn them
        off:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>@page first: {
    
  /* No running heads on chapter opener pages */
  @top-left {
    content: none;
  }

  @top-right {
    content: none;
  }

}</code></pre></div>
      <p class="p">Note that you do not have direct control over the width of top and bottom margin boxes or
        the height of left and right margin boxes.</p>
      <div class="p">You can construct the content of a margin box from literal text, string variables, saved
        elements, and counter
        references:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>@page {
   ...

  /* Folio-by-chapter numbering */
  @bottom-center {
    <strong class="ph b">content: counter(chapter-number) "-" counter(page);
</strong>  }</code></pre></div>
      <p class="p">This will create the result "1-1" for the first page of the first chapter.</p>
      <div class="p">CSS provides two mechanisms for capturing content to be used by reference:<ul class="ul" id="topic_fws_skc_vcb__ul_mvs_2wc_vcb">
          <li class="li">String variables</li>
          <li class="li">Saved elements</li>
        </ul></div>
      <p class="p">String variables can be set from the content or attribute values of elements without
        disturbing those elements. Saved elements capture entire elements but take those elements
        out of the main flow.</p>
      <p class="p">Creating and managing string variables and saved elements is complete subject on its own
        and is covered elsewhere.</p>
      <p class="p">String variables are easy to create and reference but are limited as to what you can do to
        style them, as they will reflect only the styles set for the entire box: there is no way to
        style different referenced string variables differently in a single box.</p>
      <p class="p">By contrast, element variables are literally moved into the margin box with all their
        markup structure intact, so you can style them just as you would in any other contexts.</p>
      <div class="note tip note_tip"><span class="note__title">Tip:</span> You cannot use saved elements with anything else in the
          <span class="keyword">content:</span> property of a margin box.</div>
      <div class="p">For example, say you need to have up to three levels of heading reflected in the running
        heading, with each level on its own line. You can't do this with string variables so you
        have to use saved
        elements:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>@page :right {

  ...

  /* Multi-line running head */
  @top-right {
    <strong class="ph b">content: element(sectionTitles last);</strong>
  }
  ...
}</code></pre></div>
      <p class="p">The name "sectionTitles" refers to an element that has been saved by the rule for the
        element that provides section titles data. The keyword <span class="keyword">last</span> indicates
        that the value should be the last set for the variable on the current page. On a left-hand
        page you would use the keyword <span class="keyword">start</span> to get the value current at the
        start of the page.</p>
      <div class="p">The saved element "sectionTitles" could have been created like
        so:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>running-head-section-titles {
  position: running(sectionTitles);
}</code></pre></div>
      <p class="p">The <span class="keyword">position:</span> property value "running()" takes the context element
        (&lt;running-head-section-titles&gt; in this case) and saves it for later reference via an
          <span class="keyword">element()</span> reference in a margin box.</p>
      <div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title">Note:</span> Elements with a <span class="keyword">position:</span> of "running()" are taken out of the normal
        flow. That means that you can't, for example, store a section's title element and also have
        that title display in the normal flow. This means that you must have separate elements to
        hold the structured content you need for margin boxes. This is one of the main reasons that
        even directly-authored HTML needs to be transformed to make it ready to style with
        CSS.</div>

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title11">Footnotes</h2>
    <div class="body">
      <div class="p">Pages can have a footnote region that is used only if there are footnotes on the page,
        defined by the <span class="keyword">@footnote</span>
        rule:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>@page {
   
  ...

  @footnote {
    width: 100%;
    border-top: 0.5pt solid black;
    margin-top: 0.5in;
    border-length: 0.5in;    
  }
}</code></pre></div>
      <div class="p">You create footnotes by using a <span class="keyword">float:</span> value of
        "footnote":<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>aside.footnote {
  <strong class="ph b">float: footnote;</strong>
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
  font-size: 10pt;
  text-align: justify;
  text-indent: 1pc;
  text-transform: none;
}  </code></pre></div>
      <div class="p">When you create a footnote float, a <span class="keyword">::footnote-call</span> pseudo-element is
        left in its place so you can create an appropriate footnote reference,
        e.g.:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>aside::footnote-call {
  content: counter(footnote);
  font-size: 8pt;
  vertical-align: super;
}</code></pre></div>
      <p class="p">The counter named "footnote" is not built inâ€”you need to define the count to use for
        footnotes in your page masters. See <a class="xref" href="#topic_zdz_y1d_vcb">Page Numbers and Other Counters</a>.</p>
      <div class="p">With the footnote area the floated footnote element is preceded by a
          <span class="keyword">::footnote-marker</span> pseudo-element, which you can use to generate the
        footnote number or callout within the footnote
        area:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>aside::footnote-marker {
  content: counter(footnote);
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
  font-size: 8pt;
  vertical-align: super;
  display: inline;  
}</code></pre></div>
      <div class="p">If you want to use a sequence of symbols instead of numbers, you can specify the symbol set
        as part of the <span class="keyword">counter()</span>
        reference:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>aside::footnote-call {
  content: counter(footnote<strong class="ph b">, symbols('*' 'â€ ' 'â€¡')</strong>);
  font-size: 8pt;
  vertical-align: super;
}

aside::footnote-marker {
  content: counter(footnote<strong class="ph b">, symbols('*' 'â€ ' 'â€¡')</strong>);
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
  font-size: 8pt;
  vertical-align: super;
  display: inline;  
}</code></pre></div>
      <p class="p">This will create callouts with the symbols, e.g. "*", "â€ ", "â€¡", "**", "â€ â€ ", etc.</p>
      <p class="p">Note that the current CSS footnote specification is underspecified and thus leaves a lot to
        processors in terms of exactly how to manage the rendition of footnotes. If you have
        out-of-the-ordinary footnote requirements you will almost certainly need to use extensions
        provided by your CSS engine.</p>

    <h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title12">Page Numbers and Other Counters</h2>
    <div class="body">
      <p class="p">CSS does not have a built-in notion of "page number" the way that XSL-FO does, for
        example.</p>
      <p class="p">Rather you define your own counters and then refer to them in margin boxes or in the main
        flow using counter references.</p>
      <div class="bodydiv fo-mapping">
        <p class="p">CSS does not have the same concept of "folio" as FO 1.1 does. In XSL-FO the page number
          counter is a property of the page sequence. In XSL-FO 1.1 you can also define a prefix and
          suffix for the folio that is then reflected in page number references. CSS does not have
          these concepts, so any kind of page number prefix or suffix is created with literal text
          as part of the <span class="keyword">content:</span> property of the margin boxes that reflect page
          numbers.</p>
        <p class="p">The CSS equivalent of FO page number setting, resetting, and incrementing is done through
          normal CSS counter controls within the <span class="keyword">@page</span> rule.</p>
        <div class="p">In CSS you create a new variable simply by naming it in a
            <span class="keyword">counter-reset:</span> or <span class="keyword">counter-increment:</span>
          property:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>/* Base page definition */
@page {
  <strong class="ph b">counter-increment: page;</strong>
}

@page :first {
  <strong class="ph b">counter-reset: page;</strong>
}</code></pre></div>
        <p class="p">The first <span class="keyword">@page</span> rule have the effect of creating counter named "page"
          and indicates that it should be incremented for each new page (the initial value of a
          counter is zero (0) unless explicitly set to a different value).</p>
        <p class="p">The <span class="keyword">@page</span> rule for <span class="keyword">:first</span> pages resets the counter
          "page", which sets the counter to zero. The inherited base <span class="keyword">@page</span> rule
          will then cause the counter to be incremented, making the page counter value for first
          pages "1".</p>
        <p class="p">Note that there's no magic to the counter name "page" here, it's just an obvious
          convention.</p>
        <p class="p">Note that you're not limited to a single counter either.</p>
        <p class="p">For example, in one of my projects they wanted to have a "page n of m" tagline on pages
          when doing draft printing, that reflects the absolute page numbers and the total number of
          pages.</p>
        <div class="p">To do this I simply created a second counter that is never
          reset:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>/* Base page definition */
@page {
  counter-increment: page;
  counter-increment: absPage; /* Absolute page number */
}</code></pre></div>
        <div class="p">As part of the HTML preparation transform I generated a paragraph with a fixed ID value
          as the last paragraph in the book, ensuring that it would always be on the last
          page:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>  ...
  <strong class="ph b">&lt;p id="last-element-in-pub"&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</strong>&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre></div>
        <div class="p">With those two things I could then create a tagline in one of the otherwise unused margin
          boxes:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>@page {

  ...

  @top-left {
    <strong class="ph b">content: Page counter(absPage) of target-counter('#last-element-in-pub', absPage);</strong>
  }
  
  ...

}</code></pre></div>
        <p class="p">The <span class="keyword">counter()</span> function gets the current value of the "absPage" counter
          while the <span class="keyword">target-counter()</span> function gets the value as it is for the
          referenced element, which we know will always be on the last page.</p>
        <p class="p">You can increment the counter by a value other than one (1).</p>
        <div class="p">For example, you need to produce a publication where all the left-hand pages will be
          printed from your source but the right-hand pages will produced in a different way and
          interleaved later, but you want the page numbers to be normal, with even numbers on
          left-hand pages. But you're only generating the left-hand pages, so you need to increment
          by
          2:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>@page {
  <strong class="ph b">counter-increment: page 2;</strong>
  @bottom-left {
    content: "Page " counter(page);
  }
}

@page :first {
  <strong class="ph b">counter-reset: page 2;</strong>
}</code></pre></div>
        <p class="p">The value "page 2" for <span class="keyword">counter-increment:</span> says "increment counter
          'page' by 2". The value "page 2" for the <span class="keyword">counter-reset:</span> property says
          "Set counter 'page' to the value '2'".</p>
        <p class="p">In a typical publication you will need to count many things in addition to pages:
          chapters and sections, footnotes, figures, tables, etc.</p>
        <p class="p">For most of these it is probably easier or better to do the counting in your HTML
          preparation transform rather than using CSS counters.</p>
        <p class="p">However, some counters depend on the pagination, such as footnotes.</p>
        <div class="p">To number footnotes within pages you define a footnote counter and then reset it for each
          page:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>@page {
  counter-reset: footnote;

    <h1 class="title topictitle1" id="ariaid-title14">HTML Preparation Transforms</h1>
  
    <div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">It is always necessary to do some amount of preparation of your HTML to make it ready
    for pagination with CSS.</p>
        <p class="p">While CSS style sheets are relatively easy to author and understand, CSS depends on their
      being specific structures and structural patterns in the HTML to be styled. In addition, CSS
      selectors have limitations compared to XPath that again require additional things in the
      HTML.</p>
    <p class="p">The assumption here is that the HTML you're starting with is either generated from some
      non-HTML source such as DITA, DocBook, S1000D, TEI, or any similar documentation-focused XML
      vocabulary or is authored directly but without requiring authors themselves to add all the
      things that might be required for pagination.</p>
    <p class="p">Thus, there always needs to be some amount of preparation applied to the starting HTML to
      make it ready to be paginated with CSS.</p>
    <div class="p">The main tasks that the preparation transform needs to perform are:<ul class="ul" id="html-preparation-transforms__ul_gzy_n2h_vcb">
        <li class="li">Construct elements needed to populate page margin boxes to create running headers,
          running feet, or side elements (for example thumb tabs).</li>
        <li class="li">Add @class attribute values or other attributes to elements to work around limitations
          in CSS selectors. In particular, you cannot select elements based on properties of
          following siblings or get attribute values from ancestor elements.</li>
        <li class="li">Generate tables of contents, back-of-the-book indexes, and other structures that are
          part of your deliverable but not authored in the source.</li>
        <li class="li">Move elements that are not presented in the order they are authored. For example, in
          DITA moving the titles of figures to the bottom of the figure container (DITA figures are
          authored with the figure title as the first subelement of the figure container).</li>
        <li class="li">Add wrapper elements in order to control page sequence association or otherwise make
          styling easier.</li>
      </ul></div>
    <p class="p">While there are many technology choices for processing HTML and XML the typical way to
      implement this kind of transformation is XSLT. This topic assumes that you are using XSLT and
      that you have a basic understanding of XSLT 2. While XSLT 3 is published and supported by at
      least the Saxon family of XSLT engines, nothing in HTML preparation requires XSLT 3-specific
      features. Most of what you need to do can be done easily enough in XSLT 1 with the exception
      of tasks like index generation and other grouping-related tasks, which are very hard to do in
      XSLT 1 but relatively easy to do in XSLT 2 using the for-each-group instruction.</p>
    <div class="p">While the concern of CSS styling is largely separate from the concern of HTML preparation,
      there is some coordination required. In particular, there needs to be agreement on the
      following details:<ul class="ul" id="html-preparation-transforms__ul_mw1_1qh_vcb">
        <li class="li"><code class="ph codeph">@class</code> attribute values and naming conventions. As a general practice,
          the <code class="ph codeph">@class</code> values should reflect all semantic distinctions made in the
          source XML in order to give the CSS author as many options as possible. Some typographic
          effects may require additional class values, such as classes to reflect details of
          following siblings or children (because selectors cannot select based on the properties of
          following siblings or descendants).</li>
        <li class="li">Structural details, such as where additional <code class="ph codeph">&lt;div&gt;</code> or
            <code class="ph codeph">&lt;span&gt;</code> elements are required in order to make styling possible or
          more convenient. As a general rule, more structure is better but too much structure can
          make some selection tasks harder. Creating new page sequences with specific page masters
          requires having wrapper elements to associate the page sequence with, so that may also
          require the additional of additional wrappers.</li>
        <li class="li">Generation of elements to be captured as element variables for use in margin boxes.</li>
        <li class="li">Generation of numbers as literal text with distinguishing markup to avoid the need to
          use CSS counters where doing the counting in the transform is either required or easier to
          implement. Doing counting in the transform allows the CSS styles to be more generic. Doing
          enumeration in with CSS counters makes the transform more generic where there could be
          presentational differences in how things are numbered.</li>
        <li class="li">Page number formats for elements that generate page number references. Because page
          numbering details are not properties of page masters but simply use normal CSS counters,
          when making a page number reference you have to know, for the element you're referencing,
          how the page number should be formatted: arabic, roman numerals, or alphabetic. The number
          format details are not a property of the counter nor are they a property of the page
          master itself, so you have to specify the number formatting as part of the
            <span class="keyword">target-counter()</span> specification, which means you need to put that
          information on the element that will generate the page number reference.</li>
        <li class="li">Markup details for tables of contents and other generated structures.</li>
      </ul></div>
    <p class="p">HTML preparation transforms that are intended to be more or less generic so that they can be
      used for a variety of documents or types of documents and support a variety of different page
      designs should provide clear extension points to make it easy to adapt them to specific
      requirements.</p>

        typical example of this would be a running head that reflects chapter or section titles
        where the title may contain inline markup that should be reflected in the running head as
        well. For example, in a software-related manual you might have titles that include mentions
        of keywords or functions where they keywords or functions are given a distinct typographic
        treatment.</p>
      <p class="p">As a general rule, you should assume that all titles reflected in running heads or feet may
        having embedded markup that needs to be preserved and thus the use of element variables is
        required.</p>
      <p class="p">Because elements with a <span class="keyword">position:</span> of <span class="keyword">running()</span> are
        taken out of the normal flow, you cannot simply use the element you want to reflect in the
        margin box directly. You must create a new element whose only purpose is to be the element
        variable you need for the margin box.</p>
      <div class="p">For example, if the base HTML markup for a chapter
        is:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>&lt;section id="chapter-123" class="chapter"&gt;
  &lt;header&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="enumeration"&gt;Chapter 1. &lt;/span&gt;
        <strong class="ph b">&lt;span class="title"&gt;Understanding The &lt;span class="cmd"&gt;doall&lt;/span&gt; Command&lt;/span&gt;</strong>&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    ... body of section ...
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</code></pre>and
        you want the content of the "title" <code class="ph codeph">&lt;span&gt;</code> element as the running
        heading, you cannot simply use <code class="ph codeph">position: running(chapterTitle);</code> on the
          <code class="ph codeph">&lt;span&gt;</code> element because that would take it out of the main flow,
        leaving the chapter title as just "Chapter 1. ".</div>
      <p class="p">Instead, you need to create a new element that has a copy of the elements you want. Note
        that you aren't limited to HTML-defined elements at this point, so you can name your
        generated elements anything you want. An obvious choice is to use the same name for the
        generated elements as for the element variables that use them. However, the names you use
        are arbitrary as long as they are sufficiently distinct.</p>
      <div class="p">If the CSS expects the element variable to have the name "chapterTitle" then the prepared
        HTML can look like
        this:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>&lt;section id="chapter-123" class="chapter"&gt;
  &lt;header&gt;
    <strong class="ph b">&lt;chapterTitle&gt;&lt;span class="title"&gt;Understanding The &lt;span class="cmd"&gt;doall&lt;/span&gt; Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/chapterTitle&gt;</strong>
    &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="enumeration"&gt;Chapter 1. &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Understanding The &lt;span class="cmd"&gt;doall&lt;/span&gt; Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    ... body of section ...
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</code></pre></div>
      <p class="p">Note that the <code class="ph codeph">&lt;chapterTitle&gt;</code> element is the first thing in the
          <code class="ph codeph">&lt;header&gt;</code> element. This is to ensure that it is the first thing on any
        page started by this section so that the "start" and "first" options for element variable
        references will produce the correct result.</p>
      <div class="p">To capture the <code class="ph codeph">&lt;chapterTitle&gt;</code> element as an element variable you use
          <span class="keyword">position:</span> with the <span class="keyword">running()</span>
        function:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>chapterTitle {
  position: running(chapterTitle);
}</code></pre></div>
      <p class="p">This rule selects all <code class="ph codeph">&lt;chapterTitle&gt;</code> elements and stores them in an
        element variable named "chapterTitle". Note that there's no requirement that the element and
        the element variable have the same name, that's just the convention used here. Because the
        position of "running" takes element out of the normal flow you don't have to do anything
        here in order to prevent the <code class="ph codeph">&lt;chapterTitle&gt;</code> element from being presented
        in the main flow.</p>
      <div class="p">Finally, in the <span class="keyword">@page</span> rules for the pages that need to reflect the
        chapter title in margin boxes, you would refer to the "chapterTitle" variable using the
          <span class="keyword">element()</span>
        function:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>@page :left {
  
  @top-left {
    <strong class="ph b">content: element(chapterTitle);</strong>
  }
}</code></pre></div>
      <div class="p">Finally, to style the copied <code class="ph codeph">&lt;span&gt;</code> element with the chapter title in
        the margin box, you use a selector that includes the element
          <code class="ph codeph">&lt;chapterTitle&gt;</code>:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>
/* Chapter title as used in margin boxes: */

chapterTitle span.title {
  font-size: 8pt;
  font-weight: normal;
}</code></pre></div>
      <div class="p">The styling for the "cmd" span should not specify it's font size so that it will inherit it
        in whatever context it occurs
        in:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>span.cmd {
  font-family: monospace;
  font-weight: bold;
}</code></pre></div>
      <p class="p">With these rules and the generated <code class="ph codeph">&lt;chapterTitle&gt;</code> element you should
        now get bold, monospaced font for the command name "doall" in the running heading, as well
        as in the chapter title as presented in the main flow.</p>
      <p class="p">Note that there is an unavoidable need for coordination between the author of the CSS style
        sheet and the author of the HTML preparation transform so that the transform author and CSS
        author know what elements are required in order to populate the margin boxes
        appropriately.</p>
