# CSS Pagination Book

Author: Eliot Kimber

This project provides the DITA source for a how-to book on using CSS for pagination.

The goal of this book is to collect in one place all the details you need to understand in order to use CSS pagination effectively.

One challenge with using CSS for pagination is that the CSS pagination specifications are scattered across a number of different specification documents, most of which are actively being updated and modified. This makes it hard to know, at any moment in time, what the current state of the CSS pagination specification is.

The set of tools, both commercial and open-source, that implement CSS pagination is changing constantly.

The most complete implementations are commercial:

* Antenna House Formatter, antennahouse.com
* Prince XML, https://www.princexml.com/
* VersaType (formerly Vivliostyle) from Trim-Marks: https://trim-marks.com/en/
Open-source implementations include:

* Vivliostyle: https://vivliostyle.org/
* Weasyprint: https://weasyprint.org
* ???

This publication is available for free in its HTML form as published through this github repository.

The intent is to publish it as a printed book.
